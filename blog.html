    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. Discuss the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        var, let, and const are three different variable declaration keywords in JavaScript, each with its own scope and behavior. They were introduced to provide better control over variable scope and mutation in different scenarios. Here's an overview of their scopes and characteristics:
</p>
<p>
        var:
        var is the oldest variable declaration keyword in JavaScript. It has function scope, which means that variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of the function or global scope in which they are defined. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, as the variable might be accessible before its actual declaration in the code.
    </p>
    <p>

        let:
        let was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to address the issues with var by providing block scope. Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their block (whether it's a function, loop, or conditional statement), but they are not accessible before their declaration within that block.
    </p>
    <p>
        const:
        const is also introduced in ES6 and, like let, it has block scope. However, it is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. This makes it suitable for declaring constants or values that should remain unchanged throughout their scope.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">2. Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        null:

        null is a deliberate assignment that indicates the absence of any value or an empty value.
        It is often used to explicitly clear or reset the value of a variable or object property to indicate that it has no value or is intentionally empty.
        It can be used in situations where you want to represent the absence of a value, such as when a value cannot be determined or when a variable needs to be explicitly set to "nothing."</p>
<p>
undefined:

undefined is a value that is automatically assigned to a variable when it is declared but not initialized with any value.
It can also be the value returned by functions that do not explicitly return anything.
It indicates that a variable has been declared but not assigned any value, or that a property does not exist in an object.

    <hr>
    <p>
        What is a REST API? An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
